# Bellman Conformal Inference (BCI) – Time Series Prediction


# Overview
This project reproduces the results from the research paper:
"Bellman Conformal Inference: Calibrating Prediction Intervals for Time Series" by Yang et al. (2024).
The paper introduces Bellman Conformal Inference (BCI), an extension of Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI), which dynamically calibrates multi-step ahead prediction intervals using stochastic control techniques.

# Core Concepts
Conformal Inference: Distribution-free method to generate prediction intervals

ACI: Adapts intervals based on past coverage errors (gradient descent-style)

BCI: Optimizes interval length + coverage using Bellman's equation and Model Predictive Control (MPC)

# Models & Implementation
Reproduced Models from the paper:

ARMA-GARCH(1,1) for stock return volatility (Microsoft stock via Yahoo Finance)

Transformer-based model for returns

LSTM for Google Trends (keyword: "deep learning")

Interval methods compared:

Fixed-width

ACI

BCI (main contribution)

# Reproduction Setup
Config files modified to include ACI, BCI, and Fixed models

Miscoverage rates (β) computed using z-scores

Evaluation at multiple confidence levels: 95%, 80%, 50%

# Key Results
BCI outperforms ACI in maintaining coverage while minimizing average interval length

BCI avoids infinite-length intervals, which were observed in ACI under tight constraints

Results are consistent with findings reported by Yang et al. (2024)

# Limitations
BCI has higher computational complexity due to dynamic optimization

Difficult to tune for datasets with high volatility or noise

Reproduction may vary slightly with different random seeds and window sizes
